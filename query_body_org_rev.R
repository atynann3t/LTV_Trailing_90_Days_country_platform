# added to line 102 to 104 
# AND cast(joindate as timestamp) >= DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), -97, 'DAY')
# also added a join to Left Join [n3twork-marketing-analytics.TEMP_ANALYSIS.country_code_lookup] b
# to get b.country as country_name to be able to filter on top countries 
# the filtering is on line 96
